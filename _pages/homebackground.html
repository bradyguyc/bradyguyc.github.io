  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>One of the things I like about Microsoft is that they have invested heavily in documentation. In particular I have found Azure, Xamarin, and Visual Studio to have an extensive amount of content. In addition to the official documentation there is an enormous amount of content from the development community. So much content that at times it feels like a  maze and finding the most relevant content can take some time.</p>
<p>I have been following the Xamarin product since long before it became part of Microsoft. While there are several frameworks for mobile development I have stayed pretty loyal to Xamarin. I have spent a fair amount of time toying with mobile apps but have yet to fully deploy a mobile app in the market place.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago during my spare time, what limited amount of it there is, I decided to develop an app and see if I could take it from start to finish and actually get it in the app stores. That’s a pretty lofty goal for someone like me. See, it’s the thrill of discovery that excites me and once I have figured something out, polishing it up and getting it completed is, well not my best quality.</p>
<p>What I noticed with the overwhelming amount of content on Xamarin development is that most articles and documentation is focused on narrow aspects and topics. I also discovered I had a desire to start writing and share learnings and discoveries with a broader community. To that end I decide that I would attempt to put together a start to finish journal of my journey. Building, testing, and deploying a mobile app. With the intent of sharing a map of the journey with links to the articles and insights that most helped along the way.</p>
