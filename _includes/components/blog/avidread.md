Being an avid reader of various book series I was using a website called fictfact to keep track of my reading.  It was a great website provided exactly what was needed no more no less, until it didn't exist anymore. 

I got the impression that it was not getting the funding it needed and or Amazon stepped in with some type of your not following the rules and had them shutdown.  I was able to export my reading list before they shutdown but I was left without any means to track what books were in what series and which ones I had read.

I spent a good year searching for something that was as simple and easy to use.  Nothing hit the spot like fictfact did.  Similar capabilities were out there but just not as easy to use, clear and concise a user interface.  

I decided, no more reading until I built an app that provided similar functionality.  And that's where I find myself two or three years later building an app primarily for my personal use and the thrill of learning.
